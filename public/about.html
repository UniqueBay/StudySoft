            <br />Literacy and Numeracy isn't enough anymore! You want your
            child to be properly equipped to face a future that would not
            include you. <br />However, many of the skills which were considered
            "Hot Cake" 5 years ago are no longer relevant today. We live in
            revolutionary times and it is impossible to know what skills will be
            needed in the future that your children will live in.<br />
            "Google maps" have rendered jobless- the personal driver who knows
            all the shortcut in the city. Driverless cars will soon make all
            drivers irrelevant. This is just an example using the transportation
            industry. In the near future, machines will automate so many of the
            jobs that humans proudly do.<br />
            So how can you ensure that your childs' future is secure? The only
            lasting favor that you can do for your children, is to teach them
            how to learn, how to think for themselves, so that they can grow
            into self-reliant adults.<br />
            Enroll your Teenager into our 6 month "LEARNACY" course and they
            will grow up ready to face any challenge that the future may bring.
            They will grow up equipped to learn whatever skills may be required
            in an ever changing future economy!<br />
            To enroll your child, leave us a message in the contact page and one
            of our representatives will respond as soon as possible.<br />
